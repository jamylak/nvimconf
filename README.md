# nvim config
Currently moved back to `NVIM v0.11.1`
to fix issue with nvim opening telescope immediately with command

Note: This comes from:
https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/

Though I've now updated it so it only works for me due to a lot
of hardcoding. There are lots of bad practices in here.
